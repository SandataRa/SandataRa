### Hello, it's Sandratra! 👋

Passionate about BI, data & analytics, I have applied my skills in actively contributing to the creation of end-to-end analytical platforms, from data ingestion to visualization for the past 7 years. I'm sharing my journey in Business Intelligence and Data Engineering. 

🔭 I’m currently working on Microsoft Fabric & Azure.  
🌱 I’m currently learning Databricks.  
⚡ Fun fact: I'm a fan of Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock)

Let's collaborate along the journey!
