### Hello, it's Sand! 👋

Passionate about BI, data & analytics, I have applied my skills in actively contributing to the creation of end-to-end analytical platforms, from data ingestion to visualization, for the past +8 years. I'm sharing my journey in IT engineering from data solutions to AI applications. 

🔭 I’m currently working on Azure & MS Fabric & Databricks.  
🌱 I’m currently learning ADK & Terraform.  
⚡ Fun fact: I'm a fan of Dwayne Johnson.

Let's collaborate along the journey!
